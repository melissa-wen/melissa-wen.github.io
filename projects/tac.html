        <div class="description">
            <p>OVERVIEW: Thornhill Athletic Council (TAC) is a student-run council that works directly with Thornhill
                Secondary School (TSS) to support funding healthy active living in the community and help fund TSS’s
                athletic program.
            </p>
            <p>
                TASK: As a Co-Director of Fundraising, I had to think of a creative way to get rid of a lot of sports
                wear that were no longer in use. After discussing with the teacher advisors, we settled on doing a
                silent auction for the garments during lunch periods over the course of several days. The only question
                now was how to promote old sports wear to the students of TSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                PLAN: Photograph TAC members modelling the garments and produce a promotional video for the fundraiser.

                        <h3>1. Storyboarding</h3>
                        <p>When the teacher advisors first proposed this idea, the first thing that popped into my head
                            was to campaign this fundraiser as a “retro sale”. Vintage fashion was rising in public
                            interest at the time, and the fact that the garments we were selling were authentic vintage
                            pieces, the theme and product fit together perfectly. After looking at all the garments in
                            our iventory, I created a mood board to reflect the vision I had for this campaign and
                            headlined this project as TAC X RETRO.

                        <h3>2. Execution</h3>
                        <p>To really hit that relatability factor and resonate with the student body, I asked TAC
                            members to model the garments that we were selling. I wanted to do my best to make the
                            photos to look as professional as possible, so I took a photography crash course from the
                            friend who lent me her camera. With my limited experience as a photographer and the help
                            from the TAC graphics department on set, we pulled together a two-day shoot so the
                            photographs could get edited and posted in time for the fundraiser.

                        <h3>3. Post-production</h3>
                        <p>The photos were a challenge to edit since there were several different locations each
                            sporting different lighting. Due to this, I opted to pair together photos with smiliar
                            ambient lighting so the overall image looks cohesive. As for the layout, I was inspired by
                            various fashion retailers and how they list their products on their Instagram, so I included
                            the garment and model names in some white space next to the corresponding photo.

        <p>The fundraiser was an overwhelming success, with the Instagram posts of this campaign garnering an
            average of 115 likes per post and selling over 50 garments. This campaign was definately one of the
            highlights of my senior year in high school and while it came with its fair share of challenges, I had a
            lot of fun working with my talented council members! Feel free to check out the @tssathleticcouncil
