        <h1>CFS Merchandise Design</h1>
        <div class="description">
            <p>OVERVIEW: CAISA Fashion Show (CFS) is the largest student-run charity fashion show in Canada. Each year,
                they donate the proceeds made from fundraising events and the annual fashion show to Children’s Health
                foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
                TASK: As a member of the graphics department, I had to create a merchandise design for CFS executives
                that would commemorate the 2020-2021 fashion show.
            </p>
            <p>
                PLAN: Work together with the CFS Internal Relations department to create designs that would represent
                the show’s theme (Orpheus & Euridice)
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="process">
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <div class="project-row-odd">
                <div class="project-column">
                    <img src="../images/cfs1.png" alt="theme">

                        <h3>1. Theme</h3>
                        <p>The Internal Relations department wanted the merch to centre around the story for this year’s
                            fashion show, Orpheus & Euridice. Following that thought, we collected some references that
                            conceptualized “lovers” to aid with the drawing process.

                <div class="project-column">
                    <div class="project-text">
                        <h3>2. Style</h3>
                        <p>We discussed various design methods, but ultimately settled on the single-line art style.
                            This
                            was largely due to the fact that the show’s logo was already drawn in the single-line style.
                            Other CFS graphics also already had elements of that art style, so we decided to keep in the
                            merch in the same vein as the aformentioned graphics.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="project-column project-text">
                    <div class="project-text">
                        <h3>3. Composition</h3>
                        <p>When it came to composition, I decided to use plants as a way to guide the viewer’s eyes
                            throughout the design. Internal Relations also wanted to include plants to give it more of
                            an
                            ancient-greek feel, so it fit perfectly. Wanting to explore the concept, I drafted two very
                            different designs while still following the theme and style.
                        </p>
                        <p>For the first design, I took great inspiration from Hanz Zatska’s piece, “Lover’s Embrace”,
                            since
                            it reminded me of the scene in the story where Orpheus weeps over Euridice’s corpse. The
                            second
                            design was inspired by the portraits I found while looking for single-line art references,
                            and
                            it gave me more of an oportunity to show the characters’ expressions.
                        </p>

            <h2>Final Drafts</h2>
            <img src="../images/cfs4.png" alt="final">
            <p>Overall, I am really satisfied with how the final drafts turned out. There were some challenges along the
                way since I’m still very new to the single-line art style, but I think these drafts really capture the
                theme of the 2020-2021 fashion show. Now all that’s left is for the exec team to vote on which design
                they like best-- I can’t wait to see which design CFS ultimately goes with! </p>
