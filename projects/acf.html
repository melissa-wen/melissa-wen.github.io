        <h1>ACF Merchandise Promotion</h1>
        <div class="description">
            <p>OVERVIEW: Asian Christian Fellowship (ACF) is one of the Christian faith clubs at Western University.
                Every year, they design merch themed around a particular Bible verse for its members to purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
                TASK: Inspired by a Christian clothing brand, The Boy With Style, the ACF graphics team wanted an
                illustrated piece that would help promote the club’s 2020-2021 merchandise.
            </p>
            <p>
                PLAN: Work together with the merch design team to create an illustration that shows off the merch in a
                flattering way.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="process">
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <div class="project-row-odd">
                <div class="project-column">
                    <img src="../images/acf1.png" alt="ideation">
                </div>
                <div class="project-column">
                    <div class="project-text">
                        <h3>1. Ideation</h3>
                        <p>Since the merch designs were already finalized, I based the palette around the orange and
                            black colour scheme. Since our original inspiration stems from The Boy With Style’s own
                            promotional efforts, the composition for this illustration was also based on their campaign.

                    <div class="project-text">
                        <h3>2. Sketch</h3>
                        <p>I wanted the overall feel of the piece to be relaxed, so the poses are more akin with
                            “standing around” as opposed to “modeling”. There’s an inside joke about chelsea boots
                            within the fellowship, so I though it’d be a nice detail to include in the piece. I opted
                            for the standing figure to sport the hoodie and the front of the design, since the hood
                            would’ve partially covered the back design and would be frustrating to look at as a
                            close-up.
                        </p>

            <img src="../images/acf3.png" alt="final">
            <p>This piece was so much fun to illustrate-- I learned a lot about how clothes drape over the body, and how
                light behaves as it hits the clothing folds. It is currently one of my favorite illustrations, and it
                was the most challenging to complete. The ACF exec team loved how it turned out, and it received 32
                likes on the group’s Facebook page!</p>
